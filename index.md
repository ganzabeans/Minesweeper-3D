## About this Project

This project was created with Assets from Unity 3D Game Kit Lite. I created additional scripts and the game board to run the game.

Here are the Scripts that were added:

- Board Controller
- Board
- Cell
- Box Render
- Flag


BoardController

        player = GameObject.Find("Ellen");
        //Debug.Log(player);
        flag = flagPrefab.GetComponent<Flag>();
    }

    // ***** THIS METHOD ACTIVATES THE BOARD *****
    // First step will not be a mine 
    public void Click(int x, int z)
    {
        cellScript = cellObject.GetComponent<Cell>();
        board = boardObject.GetComponent<Board>();
        flag = flagPrefab.GetComponent<Flag>();
       // Debug.Log("Board script is " + board);

        boardSet += board.CreateMineFields(x, z);
        boardSet += board.AssignNum();
