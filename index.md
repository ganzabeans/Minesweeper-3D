## About this Project

This project was created with Assets from Unity 3D Game Kit Lite. I created additional scripts and the game board to run the game.

Here are the Scripts that were added:

- Board Controller
- Board
- Cell
- Box Render
- Flag


### Board Controller

The `BoardController` is the Control between the graphical interface and the actual calculations of the game. It manages the `Board` (game calculations), the `Cell`s (graphic cells that player interacts with), the `Flag`s (graphic dots), as well as the Player itself.
